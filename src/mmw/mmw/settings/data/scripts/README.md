The file `drb_perimeter.json` was generated by opening the shapefile in
smb://fileshare/projects/Stroud_ModelMyWatershed/data/drb_bnd_polygon.zip in
QGIS, and then saving as GeoJSON, making sure to set the CRS to EPSG:4326 (which
is not done by default). In order to add a buffer to `drb_perimeter.json`, run
`npm install` and then `./bufferDRB.js`. To further simplify it, feed the
generated file into [Mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.org). The output will have
to be modified slightly to put it into the same format as
`drb_simple_perimeter.json`. To test the validity of the GeoJSON, use
[GeoJSONLint](http://geojsonlint.com/). The original and simplified polygons can
be easily compared using QGIS.
